## Day 54 - Kubernetes Shared Volumes

## Task Details:

We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data.
The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.

- Create a pod named `volume-share-nautilus`

- For the first container, use image `ubuntu` with `latest` tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e `ubuntu:latest`, container should be named as `volume-container-nautilus-1`, and run a `sleep` command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume `volume-share` should be mounted at path `/tmp/media`


For the second container, use image `ubuntu` with the `latest` tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e `ubuntu:latest`, container should be named as `volume-container-nautilus-2`, and again run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume `volume-share` should be mounted at path `/tmp/cluster`


Volume name should be `volume-share` of type `emptyDir`.


After creating the pod, exec into the first container i.e `volume-container-nautilus-1`, and just for testing create a file `media.txt` with the content `Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries` under the mounted path of first container i.e `/tmp/media`


The file `media.txt` should be present under the mounted path `/tmp/cluster` on the second container `volume-container-nautilus-2` as well, since they are using a shared volume.

## Steps:

1. Create the YAML manifest file for the pod named `volume-share-nautilus`
    ```
    vi volume-share-nautilus.yaml
    ```

2. Paste the following configuration
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: volume-share-nautilus
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: volume-share
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: volume-container-nautilus-1
          image: ubuntu:latest
          command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: volume-share
              mountPath: /tmp/media
        - name: volume-container-nautilus-2
          image: ubuntu:latest
          command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: volume-share
              mountPath: /tmp/cluster
    ```

3. Create the pod
    ```
    kubectl apply -f volume-share-nautilus.yaml
    ```

4. Verify Pod is running
    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

5. Exec into first container 
    ```
    kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-1 -- bash
    ```

6. Create a test file in the first container (shared volume)
    ```
    echo "Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries" > /tmp/media/media.txt
    exit
    ```

7. Verify the test file from the second container (shared volume)
    ```
    kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-2 -- cat /tmp/cluster/media.txt
    ```
