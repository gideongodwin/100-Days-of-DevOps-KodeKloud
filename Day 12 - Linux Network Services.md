## Day 12: Linux Network Services

#### TASK DETAILS:
Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in `Stratos` Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on `port 3004` (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.
- Use tools like `telnet`, `netstat`, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.
- Once fixed, you can test the same using command `curl http://stapp02:3004` command from jump host.
- Note: Please do not try to alter the existing `index.html` code, as it will lead to task failure.


#### STEPS:
1. Test Connectivity to the App Server from `jump host`
   `telnet stapp01 3084` or try `curl http://stapp01:3004`

2. SSH into the affected server and switch to root user
    ```
    ssh tony@stapp01
    sudo -i
    ```
3. Check if Apache service is running
   `system status httpd`

4. Check logs for errors if it fails:
   `journalctl -xeu httpd.service`

5. Find what service is using port 3004
   `lsof -i :3004`

6. Kill the service
  `kill -9 <PID>`

7. Start the Apache service
   ```
   systemctl start httpd
   systemctl enable httpd

8. Confirm Apache is listening on 3004
   `ss -tulpn | grep 3004`

9. Check firewall rules
    ```
    iptables -L -n
    iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 3004 -j ACCEPT
    iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptabls

10. Restart the Apache service
    `systemctl restart httpd`

11. Go back to the jump host and verify:
    ` curl http://stapp02:3004 `
