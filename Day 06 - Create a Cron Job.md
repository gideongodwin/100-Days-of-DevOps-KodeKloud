## Day 6: Create a Cron Job

## Task Details:
The `Nautilus` system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in `Stratos DC` on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

- Install `cronie` package on all `Nautilus` app servers and start `crond` service.
- Add a cron `*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text` for root user.

## Steps:
1. Connect to the first app server and switch to root user
   ```
   ssh tony@stapp01
   sudo -i
   ```
   > When prompted, enter the password for user `tony`

2. Install cronie, start and verify crond service:
     ```
     yum install cronie -y
     systemctl start crond
     systemctl status crond
     ```
3. Add the cron job:
   ```
   crontab -e
   ```
   Insert the following line:
   ```
   */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
   ```

5. Verify the cron job:
   ```
   crontab -l
   ```
7. Run all the above commands on the remaining servers
