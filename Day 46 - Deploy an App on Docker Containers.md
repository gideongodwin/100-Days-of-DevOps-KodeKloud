## Day 46 - Deploy an App on Docker Containers

## Task Details:

The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform.

The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment.

The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task:


On `App Server 1` in `Stratos Datacenter` create a docker compose file `/opt/dba/docker-compose.yml` (should be named exactly).


The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:


`For web service:`


a. Container name must be `php_host`


b. Use image `php` with any `apache` tag. Check here for more details.


c. Map `php_host` container's port `80` with host port `8089`


d. Map `php_host` container's `/var/www/html` volume with host volume `/var/www/html`


`For DB service:`


a. Container name must be `mysql_host`


b. Use image `mariadb` with any tag (preferably latest). Check here for more details.


c. Map `mysql_host` container's port `3306` with host port `3306`


d. Map `mysql_host` container's `/var/lib/mysql` volume with host volume `/var/lib/mysql`


e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_host and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.


After running `docker compose up` you can access the app with `curl` command `curl <server-ip or hostname>:8089/`

## Steps:

1. SSH into App Server 1
    ```
    ssh tony@stapp01
    ```

2. Go to the directory
    ```
    cd /opt/dba
    ```

3. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file
    ```
    sudo vi /opt/dba/docker-compose.yml
    ```

4. Paste the following configuration into the file
    ```
    services:
      web:
        container_name: php_host
        image: php:apache
        ports:
          - "8089:80"
        volumes:
          - /var/www/html:/var/www/html
    
      db:
        container_name: mysql_host
        image: mariadb:latest
        ports:
          - "3306:3306"
        volumes:
          - /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
        environment:
          MYSQL_DATABASE: database_host
          MYSQL_USER: db_user
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: ComplexPassword123!
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: RootPassword123!
    ```

5. Run the deployement
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

6. Check if the web server is responding
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8089/
    ```
